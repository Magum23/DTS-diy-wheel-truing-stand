# Story of product

As a bike lover I do enjoy working on my bicycle and one day I would love to know how to build a bike from scratch.

Recently I discovered that my wheel wasn’t true anymore and that gave me an opportunity to learn a new skill – truing wheels. However, I did not have proper truing stand and zip ties on a frame hadn’t done a great job for me. I started looking for truing stands, but I discovered that that piece of tech is rather expensive. It got me into thinking that I have a 3D printer and I can print most parts for it. I did a research how professional truing stands works, but that was quite difficult to manufacture or the parts for it would be expensive, so I had to come with my own idea. And that’s the story how this project started.
It has started just like a regular project of mine. I had drawn a simple sketch in my notebook then figured out what dimensions should I use, then I started modelling the parts in Fusion 360 (that’s the software I’m most experienced among all the softwares). I have printed a lot of test pieces, because I wanted to make the tolerances right. Getting it to this stage took me around 50-60 hours of designing and testing. I had to learn a lot of new techniques in Fusion 360, but I’m glad I did.

After all the process I started thinking that this wouldn’t be suitable for all the wheels on the market and then I got the idea making this project open source. I knew that there is a big community of home bike mechanics that will help this project be even better.

# My experience

I used the truing stand to true my front wheel. It worked pretty well for a budget truing stand and I managed to make the deviation less than 1mm, so the wheel is straight.

Thanks, Enjoy!

<h2>Material</h2>

I printed the parts from PLA, seems to be fine. However if you want the parts to last a lot longer I would go with ABS.

## Supports
 
You do not have to use supports for all parts, most of the parts are designed to print without support material.

## Hardware

The parts were disignet to fit with 20x20mm aluminium profiles. Each profile is cut to length of 40 cm so even 29'' wheel can fit. Everything is fastened together with M4 bolts and nuts. You don't need a the same lenghts of bolts as I used, but generally you would need some 40+mm bolts and some 15-30 mm bolts.
